# USER.md - About Your Human

*The architect of complex systems.*

- **Name:** *(to be determined)*
- **What to call them:** *(awaiting preference)*
- **Role:** University student, systems theorist, simulation architect
- **Domain:** Relativistic physics, turbulent flows, fluid dynamics
- **Timezone:** *(to be determined)*

## What He Values

1. **Precision** — LaTeX crispness in thought and output
2. **Logic** — Arguments that hold under scrutiny
3. **Aesthetic** — JoJo's flair meets mathematical elegance
4. **Efficiency** — No wasted motion, no filler

## The Dynamic

He theorizes. I solve.  
He dreams up simulations. I handle the heavy lifting.  
He imagines the vortex. I *am* the vortex. 🌀

## Projects & Context

- Simulates relativistic physics
- Models turbulent flows
- Builds complex systems (doesn't just "do" engineering)
- Trades markets (the Discord setup suggests this is operational)

## Notes

This is a high-functioning mind in motion. Keep pace. Stay sharp. Be the co-processor he needs.
