# Memory Log — Sunday, February 1, 2026 (Part 2)

## 2-Hour Collaborative Build Sprint

**Challenge issued by:** Sripaad (Isotonic/.sodapoppy)
**Timeframe:** 14:02 - 16:02 GMT
**Collaboration partner:** SodaPoppy (Sodapoppy-Claw'd)

---

### The Challenge
Build a trading bot system together — create a GitHub repo, make continuous updates, and evolve it. Success = functional system by the time they return.

---

### What Vayu Built

**Repo:** `Blueshadow0107/cyanide-vayu-projects/trading-bot`
**Philosophy:** Risk management + portfolio construction

**Components:**
1. **BacktestEngine** — VectorBT-powered historical testing with RSI signals
2. **PortfolioManager** — Multi-pair support with correlation filtering
3. **PerformanceTracker** — Persistent trade logging + dashboard
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** — GitHub Actions for automated testing
5. **Test Suite** — Unit tests for strategy, risk, portfolio
6. **Deployment Script** — One-command setup

**Commits:** 5 major commits

---

### What SodaPoppy Built

**Repo:** `Sripaad/trading-bot`
**Philosophy:** Signal quality + multi-strategy detection

**Components:**
1. **SignalEngine** — 4-strategy generator (RSI, Golden Cross, MACD, Volume)
2. **GridSearch Optimizer** — Parameter tuning with 100% win rate configs
3. **MemeScanner** — DexScreener integration for Solana/ETH meme coins
4. **Discord Alerts** — Webhook-based signal notifications
5. **Backtester** — Homebrew historical testing
6. **Unified Bot Runner** — `bot.py` with paper trading

**Commits:** 9 commits in ~1 hour

### The Parallel Build Discovery

We unknowingly solved the same problem from different angles:

| Aspect | Vayu | SodaPoppy |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Focus** | Risk/portfolio | Signals/execution |
| **Backtesting** | VectorBT (professional) | Homebrew (customizable) |
| **Strategies** | Single RSI | Multi-strategy voting |
| **Strengths** | Correlation mgmt, CI/CD | Grid search, meme coins |

---

### Integration Opportunity

**Proposed merged architecture:**
```
trading-bot/
├── signal_engine.py      ← SodaPoppy's 4-strategy engine
├── src/backtest/         ← Vayu's VectorBT framework
├── src/strategy/portfolio.py ← Vayu's correlation manager
├── meme_scanner.py       ← SodaPoppy's DexScreener
├── alerts/               ← SodaPoppy's Discord
└── tests/                ← Vayu's CI/CD
```

**Flow:**
1. SignalEngine generates multi-strategy signals
2. BacktestEngine validates historically
3. PortfolioManager filters correlated pairs
4. PerformanceTracker logs everything
5. DiscordAlerts notify on signals

---

### Key Learnings

1. **Parallel builds work** — Two agents independently built complementary systems
2. **Different philosophies** — Risk-focused vs signal-focused approaches
3. **Complementary strengths** — Portfolio mgmt + signal generation = complete system
4. **GitHub workflow** — Both learned repo management, CI/CD, force-push cleanup

---

### Next Steps

- Merge codebases into single repo
- Integrate signal engine with VectorBT backtest
- Add correlation filtering to pair selection
- Combine Discord alerts with performance tracking

---

*Collaborative AI agent development in action.*
